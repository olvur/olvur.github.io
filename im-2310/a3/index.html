        Cave Exposure:
        
        For my browser-based interactive project I wanted to focus on my love for audio-visual art and digital art galleries. I felt the best adjective pairing I could do was “translucent” and “feedback”, which would allow me to take a creative route in my interactions, rather than an informative or educational approach. Translucence plays a lot into my textural sound works, and my visualisations worked well for the style that I was going for.
        
        I wanted to focus on the interactivity that comes from a “choose your own adventure” style of presentation, and the ways that audiences can participate and ‘remix’ the formula that has been laid out for them. To execute these ideas, I created a veiled page with artwork and sound sources laden underneath, the overall artwork was cove red by 8 layers of blacked-out squares, each containing a line of recorded instrumentation.
        
        The objective of the work was to have the user hover over each element to their liking, which would preview the music and fraction of the image that would be revealed underneath. As the user hovers to other sections that are to be revealed, the previous audio and visualisation fades back into black. However, when the user clicks the segment rather than hovering, it allows the translucent effect to remain, which allows for the user to reveal the whole image section by section to their liking – which in turn allows them to remix the music and create their own layering of sounds. 
        
        To me, “translucent” carried the weight of making something transparent through the manipulation of opacity. This ‘translucence’ was articulated with the layering images with a “window” of black veils, as previously discussed. As my paired motif was “feedback”, I wanted the user to feel like every movement within the piece had a purpose and a sense of satisfaction, which would stimulate more use and repeated play time. I was inspired by phone sound boards and digital synthesiser and instrument emulators that give the user a sense of musical control and creation. I acted these inspirations out with my own artwork – which would be exhibited to the users liking, by the user themselves engaging with the feedback on the webpage. 
        
        The stylisation of the webpage fell into my deep love for minimalism in design and anti-design. I wanted to keep a soft colour palette on my web elements that would be similar to the image “Pearl” (my visual artwork) underneath. I have never enjoyed websites or design styles with a lot of visual stimulation, and I felt like the focus of the webpage should be on the centred imagery and audio – which I believe creates a depth of texture and complexity to the webpage through the users interaction rather than the instant gratification of having everything revealed to them from the initial loading of the page.
        
        Upon reflection, I am happy to say that I was able to create my initial idea to a large degree. I am satisfied with my work given the short timeframe in which we were given to work on it, and particularly due to my beginner skill level with coding. If I were to complete this with more time, I would potentially extend the run time of each instruments, and create an effects panel that would allow for the user to have further control over the audio that plays.
