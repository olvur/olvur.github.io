            <ol> 
            <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
            <ul> -Initially, I noticed the incredible sound design that emerged from the experience.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </li>
            <ul> -Clicked the enter button
                <div>-moved my mouse candidly</div>
                <div>-viewed the entropy morph</div>
                <div>-noticed the background image behind the animation</div>
                <div>-circled my mouse spiratically</div>
                <div>-clicked the refraction/reverb button</div>
                <div>-cycled through the mouse size / vibrato rate</div>
                <div>-chronologically moved the settings back and forward to hear and see the effects</div>
                <div>-set the worm setting into full engagement</div>
                <div>-wheeled my mouse around, improvising a fun sound experiment</div>
                <div>-clicked the mute button</div>
            </ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
            <ul>-I spent most of the time trying to create audio modulations that I found aesthetically pleasing.</ul>
            <br> </br>    
            <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
            <ul>-Scrolling through the artwork and viewing the audiovisual oscillations.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
            <ul>-I believe the intended primary goal of the experience was to give the audience an audiovisual demonstration that increased traction to their sound art collective. Acting like an interactive music video.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li>
            <ul>-Through simple interactive visuals it intrigues the audience to 'play' with a sandbox-esque environment whilst listening to their compositions. </ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
            <ul>-I gathered that the experience was meant to be played for around 5 minutes, as there is a certain monotony to the experience, but the control panel does give the user the ability to modulate and modify to their hearts content, so one could potentially find themselves playing for a much longer time.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
            <ul>-I got the impression that the experience leaves an open sandbox for the user to play with it as they desire, with audio-visual oscillation being the main focus of the interactive arena.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li>
            <ul>-The experience clearly references a lot of AR/VR exhibitions that I have seen in art galleries with the Oculus Rift. It also reminds me of smart phone applications that revolve around a similar audiovisual sandbox.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What does this reference or references suggeest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</li>
            <ul>-It suggests that fluidity in movement is encouraged. It's a sensory experience with no precise narrative, so it encourages spontanious movement and actions.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it? </li>
            <ul>-I believe it's suggesting that the user should feel a sense of creation whilst using it. As you have created your desired experience out of this, it will spark curiousity to the limitations of your power as a user.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</li>
            <ul>-I believe that the most frustrating element of the experience is the overload of the sine wave oscillation that pushes through upon starting the experience, before you can change the volume and style of the audio.</ul>
            <br> </br>
            <li>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying</li>
            <ul>-As a sound designer, I find the ability to control the audial experience, within limitation, to be aesthetically pleasing and sonically satisfying.</ul></ol>
